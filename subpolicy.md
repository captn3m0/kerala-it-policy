The Information technology "start ups", essentially belong to the second category enterprises discussed above and seem to be bringing about disruptions in the sectors they are emerging. These innovators are today equipped with the power of Internet and developments in Information technology and hardware devices. They seem to be creating a market pull in unexpected directions and the convergence of ICT, mobility and cloud technologies seem to be favoring the same.
The thrust effected by re-engineered business models in the concerned sectors has been tremendous. In hospitality we have the largest accommodation provider who doesn't own a property and in Media we have the largest media company, which doesn't have a production facility. These were models unthought-of or written off not too long ago and similar disruptions are happening in education, healthcare and all such sectors.

ground floor of Water Tank Building, Kerala Technology Innovation Zone, KINFRA Hitch Park, Kochi.
By setting up the Fablab Kerala Network it is envisaged to encourage the innovation, technology development, product prototyping, maker learning, and commerciziable product development. This will empower the maker-entrepreneurial culture, which at present is confined to ICT/ electronics domain. The Fablab programme will lead to a cross learning culture among multiple technology sectors and create a robust platform for the upcoming entrepreneurs to create indigenous technology products. The Kerala fablabs are a support facility for the maker community comprising of student, startups, entrepreneurs, corporates, individual makers, research groups, academic institutions and universities across India. The Kerala Fablabs has a vibrant ecosystem for creating a maker culture among the young tech n o-entrepreneu rs, who want to develop their innovative technology idea into a product prototypes with fine design functionalities.
Mini Fab Lab
The project Mini Fab Lab aims to create mini Fab Labs across Kerala in Schools, Colleges etc. This will inturn bring in an house. development facility.
Mini Fab Lab is an effort to bring maker ecosystem to the community These Fab Labs will be based on Educational institutions and closely adhere to the university's idea of bringing out makers with proven skills in design , development and fabrication. Mini Fab Labs will work closely with the Fab Labs to take advantage of the Fab Network , Fab Academy and other Fab Lab

based initiatives. Makers based on Mini Fab Labs are allowed to connect to Fab Lab based makers / Fab Guru's at any point of time through a dedicated channel. Thiwill also make it quite easy to get maker certifications from the Fab Guru, which is a value addition to the degree certificate. Students/individuals based on Mini Fab Labs will also get the opportunity to work at Fab Labs and get them
certified as Fab Gurus.
Apart from the Mini fablabs, the Kerala Fab Academy envisages to create open maker spaces in the state. The open maker space will have all the basic machines for prototyping and will be accessible to public. The mini fablabs shall become kiosks for common people to
approach in solving societal problems.

S. KSUM2.O
Kerala Startup Mission, K-SUM (formerly Technopark TBl), the nodal agency for implementation of the policy offers, mentoring, infrastructure facilities, entrepreneurship development programmes, seed fund assistance and exposure programmers, for startups. Kerala Start UpMission has successfully implemented the startup Policy and prepared a base for a dynamic startup ecosystem. The Government is now looking at a quantum leap in the startup activities both in terms of quantity and quality. The KSUM 2.0 is an attempt in this direction.

KSUM shall focus on Innovation Driven Entrepreneurship and the
elements of triggering such innovation are expected to come out of the Academic institutions, R&D centers, Society in general (societal problems) and Rural innovators , involved in 'jugad' innovations. We are establishing a clear stream of activities connecting the technical universities and academia at large which will help scout innovations nurture them and bring them to a level of commercialization. On the other end we have R&D institutions and agencies working on cutting edge technologies that are creating intellectual property and advancements in varioius technologies for their own research or operations. These advancements however do not come out for the common good of the society nor does it translate to commercial businesses. The system will have provisions to capture such latent talents and innovations and bring them to the forefront. The biggest triggering force of commercially successful business is a societal pain point, every time an innovation addresses a problem faced by the public in a way better than it is being done currently there is a ready market/ opportunity. The system shall also plan to identify scale up and bring to notice the incremental , breakthrough or the frugal innovations done by general public especially in the rural areas. Open Innovation Platform
Open innovation platforms, an integral part of a corporate business model may be created, by which they can bring in externally generated knowledge into their business and to streamline it along with the internally generated knowledge. This will benefit them to increase their rate of innovation in the business. One way of doing it is like donating company's patent to an independent, third party organization, put them in a common pool or grant unlimited license to use to anybody. Brining in open innovation can create competitive advantage at the level of business in which ideas for innovations can emerge or go to market from outside the company as well as inside or extended to a regional level. This will aid in the exploitation of intellectual capital and making new technology products. Government shall encourage and incentivize open innovation attempts by corporates and shall facilitate the same through creation of requisite infrastructure and funding.

The government wishes to establish an annual innovation challenge which will offer a grant of Rs icr to the winner. The focus of the challenge shall be innovations which have a high societal impact and can significantly improve the lives of people.


7. Technology Commercialization Centre /Platform
This TC Center shall bridge the gap the innovators and industry. As a result, it would become a technology and knowledge transfer center. The center shall also house an exclusive state of the art research lab (similar to MIT Media Lab) wherein the innovators and industry can collaborate do research and fine tune the products.
The Platform would have two tiers
a virtual platform where we bring in all technologies to be transferred (this is already done by VSSC/ISRO, CDAC , Sree Chitra etc) , and potential productising /marketing /commercialising players Øick Up the relevant ideas and meet up/team up with them to realise.the same.
The ideas that evolve from the discussions and meet up in the virtual platform 'melting pot' shall be given space in the TC, a multi- disciplinary lab being attempted as part of the TIZ."
The Platform provides innovators and company founders with an opportunity to refine their commercialization and solicits early-stage feedback from experts as they develop a strategic plan. This program will provide with the assistance needed for a successful startup. The Platform also provides with an option to a start-up company for a licensing opportunity from research institute or university.
